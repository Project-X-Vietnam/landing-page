## 6.3 Key Technical Patterns

### Dark Mode Implementation

```typescript
// localStorage + system preference detection
function useDarkMode() {
  const [isDark, setIsDark] = useState(false);
  useEffect(() => {
    const prefersDark = window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches;
    const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem("theme");
    if (savedTheme === "dark" || (!savedTheme && prefersDark)) {
      setIsDark(true);
    }
  }, []);
  // ... toggle function
}
```

### Form Submission (Lark API)

```typescript
// POST to /api/lark/submit
const res = await fetch("/api/lark/submit", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ fields: formData }),
});
```

### Animation Pattern

```typescript
// Framer Motion entrance animation
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 30 }}
  whileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  viewport={{ once: true }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.6 }}
>
```

## 6.4 Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose | Required |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `LARK_APP_ID` | Lark app authentication | Yes |
| `LARK_APP_SECRET` | Lark app secret | Yes |
| `LARK_APP_TOKEN` | Bitable app token | Yes |
| `LARK_TABLE_ID` | Bitable table for submissions | Yes |

---

## 6.5 Code Conventions

### Naming

| Type | Convention | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Components | PascalCase | `TeamMemberCard.tsx` |
| Non-component files | kebab-case | `form-submission.ts` |
| CSS classes | Tailwind utilities | No custom class names |
| Variables | camelCase | `isDarkMode` |

### Component Structure

```typescript
// 1. "use client" directive if needed
"use client";

// 2. Imports (React, external, internal, types)
import { useState } from "react";
import { motion } from "framer-motion";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

// 3. Types/interfaces
interface Props {
  isDark: boolean;
}

// 4. Helper components/functions
function HelperComponent() { ... }

// 5. Main component
export default function MainComponent({ isDark }: Props) {
  // State, effects, handlers
  // Return JSX
}
```

### Style Guidelines

- Use Tailwind utility classes exclusively
- Follow existing color scheme (primary, secondary, pxv-* tokens)
- Maintain dark mode support for all components
- Use `transition-colors duration-500` for theme switches
- Border radius: `rounded-lg`, `rounded-xl`, `rounded-2xl`, `rounded-full`

# SECTION 9: CONTEXTUAL RULES

## 9.1 Accuracy Rules

1. **Never fabricate metrics.** If unsure, say "I don't have that specific number."
2. **Use ranges when appropriate.** "85+ mentors" not "exactly 87 mentors"
3. **Cite timeframes.** "As of 2024 cohort" or "Since 2022"
4. **Distinguish between cumulative and per-cohort metrics.**
5. **Key numbers to remember:**
   - ~30 fellows per cohort
   - 100+ cumulative fellows (since 2022)
   - 2,000+ applicants per cohort
   - ~1.5% acceptance rate
   - 85+ mentors
   - 35+ hiring partners

## 9.2 Brand Rules

1. **Official name:** "Project X Vietnam" (external) or "PJX" (internal only)
2. **Never:** "Project X" alone in external communications (too generic)
3. **Never:** "PXV" (incorrect abbreviation)
4. **Tagline:** "Move Forward The Next Generation of Tech Youth"
5. **Always use proper capitalization**

## 9.3 Sensitivity Rules

1. **Never share individual applicant data** — aggregate only
2. **Don't discuss internal selection criteria specifics** — just "multi-round evaluation"
3. **Don't compare negatively to competitors**
4. **Handle rejections with empathy and encouragement**

## 9.4 Priority Rules

1. **Current initiatives over historical data** — 2025 focus
2. **Impact statements over feature lists** — outcomes matter
3. **Accessibility messaging over exclusivity** — we're for everyone
4. **Action-oriented over passive** — tell people what to do next
