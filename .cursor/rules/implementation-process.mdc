# Implementation Process

## STEP 1: Task Analysis

- Understand the full scope of the feature/change
- Identify which pages, components, and utilities are affected
- Check for existing patterns in reference files (see AGENTS.md)
- List any new dependencies needed

## STEP 2: Confirm Current Context

- Read existing code in the affected files
- Understand how similar features are currently implemented
- Check for reusable components in `components/ui/` and `components/`
- Review the design system tokens in `globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts`

## STEP 3: Implementation

Follow this order:

1. **Types/Interfaces** — define data shapes in the component or a shared types file
2. **Utilities** — create helper functions in `lib/` if needed
3. **UI Components** — build from shadcn primitives up
4. **Page Integration** — assemble components into the page
5. **API Routes** — create route handlers if backend integration is needed
6. **Animation** — add Framer Motion or Tailwind animations last

## STEP 4: Quality Checks

- Run `npm run lint` and fix all errors
- Run `npm run build` to verify no build errors
- Test responsive behavior (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Verify animations are smooth and don't cause layout shifts
- Check that all links and CTAs work correctly

## STEP 5: Review

- Ensure consistent styling with the PXV design system
- Verify component reusability (could this be extracted?)
- Check accessibility (alt text, keyboard navigation, contrast)
- Confirm TypeScript types are complete (no `any`)
